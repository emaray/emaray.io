        <p class="card-text">
          I’m a Digital Scholarship and Instruction Librarian at Grinnell College. My professional interests include inclusive information
          literacy instruction, digital humanities, and information visualization. </p>

        <p>
          Prior to my career in libraries, I worked as a freelance academic editor, assessed standardized test responses, and taught
          first-year composition. My academic background is in English literature, but my interests include the study of
          foodways and naturalist exploration of the world. </p>

        <p> During the summer, I can be found paddling a canoe through Northwoods lakes, traipsing through prairies, and staring
          at trees hoping to glimpse a songbird or two. I’m also an enthusiastic home cook inclined toward ambitious canning
          exploits.
